Every homeowner eventually faces the same dilemma: your appliance breaks down, and you need to decide whether to call a repair technician or start shopping for a replacement. Making the right choice can save you hundreds — or even thousands — of dollars.

## The 50% Rule

The most widely recommended guideline is the **50% rule**: if the cost of repair exceeds 50% of the price of a new appliance, it is generally better to replace it. For example, if a new dishwasher costs $600 and the repair estimate comes in at $350, replacement is probably the smarter financial move.

However, this rule is just a starting point. You should also factor in the age of the appliance and how many years of useful life remain.

## Average Appliance Lifespans

Understanding how long appliances typically last helps you gauge whether a repair is worthwhile:

- **Refrigerator:** 10–18 years
- **Washing machine:** 10–14 years
- **Dryer:** 10–13 years
- **Dishwasher:** 9–12 years
- **Oven/Range:** 13–20 years
- **Microwave:** 7–10 years

If your appliance is well past the midpoint of its expected lifespan, even a modest repair bill may not be worth it. A seven-year-old washing machine with a $200 repair might be fine, but the same repair on a 12-year-old machine is harder to justify.

## Energy Efficiency Matters

Older appliances consume significantly more energy than modern ENERGY STAR-rated models. A refrigerator manufactured in 2010 can use 30–40% more electricity than a comparable 2026 model. When you factor in annual energy savings of $50–$100, the effective cost of a new appliance drops over time.

If your current appliance is more than 10 years old, request an energy cost comparison from your local utility or check the ENERGY STAR website before deciding.

## When Repair Makes Sense

Not every breakdown warrants a replacement. Repair is usually the better option when:

- The appliance is less than halfway through its expected lifespan.
- The repair cost is well under 50% of a new unit.
- The issue is a common, straightforward fix such as a worn belt, faulty thermostat, or clogged drain pump.
- The appliance is a high-end model that would be expensive to replace.

## When Replacement Makes Sense

On the other hand, lean toward replacement when:

- The appliance has needed multiple repairs in the past year.
- Parts are discontinued or difficult to source.
- The unit is past its expected lifespan.
- You notice rising utility bills that suggest declining efficiency.
- Safety concerns exist, such as a gas leak or electrical issues.

## Get a Professional Opinion

Before committing to either option, get a diagnosis from a qualified repair technician. A good technician will give you an honest assessment of the repair cost and the appliance's remaining useful life.
